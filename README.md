This is the code for the ionic circuit design tool accompanying the paper: "Harnessing Ionic Complexity: A Modeling Approach for Hierarchical Ionic Circuit Design" 

Here's an animation of the flow of ions inside an ionic circuit simulated by this tool:

## Reproduce Paper Figures

Install conda somehow. I like miniforge for this. Install `conda-lock` and `jupyterlab` somehow, maybe into the base conda environment or one specifically for that

Create the conda environment for the code from the lockfile 

```bash
cd Ionic_Circuit_Design_Tool_2025
conda lock install -n tepermeister_lumped_modeling_2025
conda activate tepermeister_lumped_modeling_2025
pip install ./Scripts
```

Then you should be able to open `plotting.ipynb` and run the code there. The first half of the `plotting.ipynb` runs the simulations and requires ![openmodelica](https://openmodelica.org/) installed.
The second half plots the simulation files generated by the first half. If you don't want to run the simulation code (some of the trials take a while), then you can download the datafiles I used from ![zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13932290), and place them in the `Simulation Datafiles` directory

Generally each of the sections in `plotting.ipynb` can be run independently as long as the code at the top of each section is run before running the subsections.

## Just use modelica library
if you just want to use the modelica library, you just need the files in `Modelica/Ionics 0.1.0.om`.
