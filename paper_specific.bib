  abstract = {After a brief survey of the state of circuit theory before World War I, the various directions of its development in the last 50 years are discussed, mainly in relation with applications to communication engineering. The early period of network design (1920-1925) was followed by the beginning of synthesis (1926-1935). The next steps were the development of feedback amplifier theory and insertion loss filter theory. The numerous new directions of research started during and after the second war are briefly mentioned. Finally recent progress is reported in formal realizability theory and in topological synthesis. A last section deals with nonlinear and linear variable circuits.},

The ability to array NLTLs to produce higher power and achieve beam steering provides an additional capability. This review summarizes the various NLTL topologies designed to achieve these design objectives. Specifically, we summarize modeling and experimental studies for three primary topologies: the lumped element NLTL, the split ring resonator, and the traditional transmission line geometry using nonlinear materials. The lumped element NLTL and the traditional transmission line constructed with nonlinear materials lend themselves to higher power applications, while the split ring resonator is better suited for applications involving antennas. We provide a detailed summary of past studies for these topologies and conclude by exploring ongoing work and future opportunities for technological development.},

Virtual prototyping entails integration of multi-domain dynamic simulation in the design process, in order to reproduce and analyze the effects of design choices on the overall performance. This paper states the requirements of the modeling language and software tool for simulation of mechatronic systems and describes an experience of use of DYMOLA with Modelica language in the simulation of a complete machining center.

  abstract = {Nowadays the trend toward multi-disciplinary and ever complex system development is becoming more and more essential to understand and improve engineering approaches for such systems in industrial product engineering and with that also poses questions to solve for research on about how to efficiently and successfully handle such systems development. Since the application area for the development of such systems is very broad, e.g. including automotive, aeronautics, robotics or consumer products and much more, on top the need for flexible and adaptable methods for the development of such systems arises as well. Such complex, interdisciplinary systems are also called mechatronic systems, referring to the synergistic integration of software, electronics and mechanics. To approach the complexity inherent in the discipline-spanning aspect, different development and integrations methods and techniques coming from the involved disciplines are applied. Especially the interdisciplinary aspect of mechatronics, makes it difficult to handle such development and still there is no such thing as a promoted unified mechatronic modeling and design language, which is capable of describing a joint model with sufficient details to manage the large number of involved system-aspects included in each of the representative domains-specific disciplines. In order to obtain a coherent model from the entire mechatronic system, an integrated model framework capable to manage various requirements and modeling specifications present in each discipline is needed. This paper will provide a comprehensive review regarding the evolution of design methodologies for mechatronic systems, investigate recent research approaches in the realm of model-based design, and also point out the problems and limitations inherent in the different concepts and finally summarize the most promising research directions.},

The current challenge is to use the discoveries of the last 20 years, such as genomics and proteomics, to develop targeted therapeutical strategies. These strategies are the result of understanding the aetiologies of complex diseases. Scientists predict the data will make personalized medicine rapidly available. However, the data need to be considered as a highly complex system comprising multiple inputs and feedback mechanisms. Translational medicine requires the functional and conceptual linkage of genetics to proteins, proteins to cells, cells to organs, organs to systems and systems to the organism. To help understand the complex integration of these systems, a mathematical model of the entire human body, which accurately links the functioning of all organs and systems together, could provide a framework for the development and testing of new hypotheses that will be important in clinical outcomes. There are several efforts to develop a `Human Physiome', with the strengths and weaknesses of each being presented here. The development of a `Human Model', with verification, documentation and validation of the underlying and integrative responses, is essential to provide a usable environment. Future development of a `Human Model' requires integrative physiologists working in collaboration with other scientists, who have expertise in all areas of human biology, to develop the most accurate and usable human model.},

  abstract = {Within the Circuits and Systems (CAS) Society, developments in computer-aided circuit analysis and circuit design commenced in the early 1950's using the earliest digital computers. Initially, computer-aided circuit analysis of linear circuits was used in design optimization, design centering, and in determining the effects of parasitics on circuit performance. Although this use of computer-aided circuit analysis has continued, computer-aided design (CAD) and circuit design automation within the CAS Society are now principally concerned with problems associated with the overall design and evaluation of very large circuits and systems. This paper is a review of a major thread of CAD activity which has occurred within CAS from the earliest and remains of major interest. This thread involves computer-aided circuit analysis (circuit simulation) and its use in CAD systems. Fortunately, several excellent review papers have appeared within the past year or two to document well the technical milestones, as well as the problems of interest at the present time. It is possible then, in this paper, to concentrate on the developments in our present capability of circuit simulators, stressing the significant trends, noting some early developments which did not become major aspects, and observing the interchange between theory and practice.},
